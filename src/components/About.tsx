              Hello! I'm Ziad Ibraheem Shehab, a first-year medical student at Suez University Faculty of Medicine. 
              I am passionate about healthcare and committed to academic excellence â€” I achieved a Distinction in my first year 
              and continue to work hard to build a strong foundation for my future medical career.

              I am particularly interested in Neurosurgery, and I look forward to developing my skills through training, 
              research, and community service. I believe that medicine is not just a profession, but a lifelong journey 
              of learning and giving back to society.
